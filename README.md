### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently working as a freelancer on three companies.

Multiple SIers âž¡ Gree âž¡ Recruit Sumai Company âž¡ InstaVR âž¡ SmartDrive.
At Gree, I've done everything from player to management (deputy director, middle management up to 200 people).
I've also worked on several projects as a freelancer. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

As an engineer, I'm good at embedded and native app development, but recently I've been doing some server-side development with Golang and Rails, as well as some PM-type stuff.

The most recent interview is [here](https://blog.smartdrive.co.jp/employee-interview-yagita/).
